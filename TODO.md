# TODO

There are some ideas to add to the project. You can add a new idea or work
on an idea from here.

### leste/leste.lua

- Implement methods to run functions:
  - beforeEachTest
  - afterEachTest
  - beforeAllTests
  - afterAllTests.

### leste/main.lua

- Add option to run a specific file (or files).
  - Maybe the [folder] argument can be [folder/file] (or [folder/files...]).
  - It's necessary to work in a way to verify if the argument is a folder or file, write a new method in leste.utils.fs.

- Add a flag to output help (-h, --help)
